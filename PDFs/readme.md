# Pulling Metadata from PDFs

This process uses [ExifTool by Phil Harvey](https://exiftool.org/).

## Usage

1. Download the EXE and place on your local machine. This is a standalone executable and does not need to be installed.
1. Update the script found in getPDFMetadata.ps1 with your local file locations and run it. 
1. The output will not be a natively readable CSV file. You can import the file into Excel and have it parse the file to make it usable.

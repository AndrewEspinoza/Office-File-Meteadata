These scripts are intended to pull metadata from Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and PDF files. This is tricky because not all the metadata is written to the file properties. Therefore, the files need to be read and the metadata pulled from within the files. 

Each file type has a folder in this repo with the scripts and files needed process the files. A README will be included in the folders with instructions.
